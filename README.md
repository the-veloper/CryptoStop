# CryptoStop

### Description
As developers at RSO, we believe that using and degrading your visitors' hardware resources for any kind of profit is not okay.
That is why we made CryptoStop.
CryptoStop blocks resources, domains and IP addresses, that are known for spreading cryptocurrency mining javascript code using the visitorâ€™s browser and hardware. It uses a blacklist of IP addresses, domains and a special javascript patterns to detect such intrusions and prevents them from loading and executing.
In addition to automatically updating the blacklist, CryptoStop offers the ability to manually allow or block specified domain or IP.

You can get the extension from:

### Will I be able to use websites, that have integrated such scripts? 

* Yes, as long as the script isn't bound to another piece of code, essential to the proper display of the website. Our goal is to provide you with a fully functioning website without the mining scripts.

### Certain website does not work properly, after I have activated the extension, but I want to use it, despite the CPU degradation - what can I do? 

* You can temporary stop CryptoStop or you can add the website to the whitelist.

### Do you collect any information about my computer or the websites I visit? 

* No.
